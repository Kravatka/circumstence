# Overview
This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to use Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA and Spring MVC. The application uses an in-memory database, so you can run it easily.

---

Letâ€™s build and run the program. Open a command line (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where you have the project files. We can build and run the application by issuing the following command:

## MacOS/Linux:
```./gradlew bootRun```

## Windows:
```.\gradlew.bat bootRun```
